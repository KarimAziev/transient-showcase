There's a lot of ways something could have gone wrong while tangling the README
into the package.

There are TODO's within the document.  Some are notes to add support to
transient.  Errata in particular is where something seems possibly broken,
missing, or unnecessarily weird.

Spot something that seems inconsistent, unclear, or an example where the
behavior is just odd?  Please file an issue.  If you can fix it, please submit a
PR or patch suggestion in your issue.

Want to add a new example?  Welcome.  PR please.

All changes must:

- Don't break =org-babel-execute-source-block=
- Don't break compile or tangle for the package
- Don't break the TOC
- Include DCO sign-off in your changes
